# Inspiration
For the final Siege week, the theme of party was very fitting! I looked at my options, and I landed on the idea of an all in one app for parties.

# Tech stack
- Swift (amazing language, what basically every modern app for Apple platforms is written in provided the developer has some sanity)  
- SwiftUI (amazing ui framework, easy to use, cant beat it, ty Apple!)
