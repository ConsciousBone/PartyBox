# How to get PartyBox
As per usual, this is the way I recommend, but there are other options available such as AltStore or SideStore; any way of sideloading apps onto iOS should work.
1. Install [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) and its dependencies; the ones you'll need depend on what OS you use, the website lists them!
2. From the [Releases](https://github.com/ConsciousBone/PartyBox) (todo: actual url) tab, find the latest release; it should be at the top. Download the attached `PartyBox.ipa` file.
3. Using a cable that supports both charge *and* data transfer, connect your device to your computer, tap `Trust` and enter your password if prompted to, then open Sideloadly.
4. In Sideloadly, click the file icon with the `IPA` text and select the previously downloaded `PartyBox.ipa` file.
5. Select your device in the `iDevice` dropdown, and make sure the name matches the device you wish to sideload PartyBox to.
6. In the `Apple ID` text field, enter your Apple Account/ID's email. If this account is a free developer account, you will have to resign PartyBox every 7 days; with a paid developer account this becomes 365 days.
7. Click the `Start` button, and enter your Apple Account/ID's password when prompted. **This will be sent straight to Apple, and no one else apart from you can read it. Not me, and not the Sideloadly developers.**
8. Wait for the app to install, and then launch it! You may need to enable Developer Mode or trust the developer, your phone will prompt you if this is required.

# Inspiration
For the final Siege week, the theme of party was very fitting! I looked at my options, and I landed on the idea of an all in one app for parties.  
With people moving to having more and more of their life on their phones, why not also have a toolkit for parties on there too?

# Tech stack
- Swift (amazing language, what basically every modern app for Apple platforms is written in provided the developer has some sanity)  
- SwiftUI (amazing ui framework, easy to use, cant beat it, ty Apple!)
